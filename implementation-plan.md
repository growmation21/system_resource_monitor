## Risk Mitigation and Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies
1. **ComfyUI-Crystools Source Code** - Required for extracting existing implementation
2. **NVIDIA GPU Drivers** - Essential for GPU monitoring features
3. **Chrome App Platform** - Verify continued support for Chrome Apps

### Technical Risks
1. **Chrome App Deprecation** - Chrome Apps are deprecated; consider Electron alternative
2. **GPU Detection Issues** - Not all systems have NVIDIA GPUs
3. **Performance Impact** - Continuous monitoring could affect system performance
4. **WebSocket Stability** - Real-time communication reliability
5. **Global Python Dependencies** - Managing dependencies without virtual environment isolation
6. **System Python Conflicts** - Ensuring compatibility with existing system Python packages

### Recommended Alternatives
- **Electron App** - More future-proof than Chrome Apps
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Modern web app with offline capabilities
- **Native Desktop App** - Using frameworks like Tauri or Qt

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Development Time**: 12-18 days
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers
- **Critical Path**: Backend monitoring → WebSocket communication → Frontend UI

## Success Criteria
1. App launches from desktop icon without virtual environment
2. All Python dependencies work with system Python installation
3. Real-time monitoring displays CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM, and temperature
4. Window is always-on-top, resizable, and movable across monitors
5. Monitoring data updates every 5 seconds (configurable)
6. CPU overhead remains under 0.5%
7. All settings persist between app restarts
8. No virtual environment required for end users

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment and dependencies
2. Extract and review code from ComfyUI-Crystools project
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish weekly progress reviews
5. Create testing protocols for each phase
